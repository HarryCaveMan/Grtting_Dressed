# Getting Dressed Is Hard!

## We made an App for that

Surely, you, like most, are prone to common wardrobe errors like putting your shoes on before your pants or socks, or puttig your had on before your shirt. Perhaps you have even tried leaving the house without a shirt!

## Simplicity is king

Why lose time getting dressed because you haven't remembered that pants are difficult withous shoes. We simplified all that, all you have to do is memorize this table that replaces clothes to easy to remember numbers! You can then copy paste those numbers into a space separated string and run this app with them to see if there are any wardrobe conflicts.
